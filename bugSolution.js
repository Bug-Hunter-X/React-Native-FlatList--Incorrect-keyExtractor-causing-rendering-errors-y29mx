To fix this, use a unique identifier from your data as the key.  This is generally a unique ID associated with each item in your data source. 

```javascript
// Correct usage:
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>

```

If your data doesn't have a unique ID, you'll need to add one or use another unique property (but using indexes directly is highly discouraged).  If you don't have unique IDs and the list's items are immutable, then a unique identifier can be generated with a library like `uuid`:

```javascript
import uuid from 'react-native-uuid';

const myDataWithIds = myData.map((item) => ({ ...item, id: uuid.v4() }));
```
Ensure that your `keyExtractor` function always returns a unique value for each item in the dataset for optimal performance and correct rendering.
